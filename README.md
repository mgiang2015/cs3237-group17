# CS3237 Group 17 Project - Team Sleep Deprived

## Introduction / Problem Statement:

Electricity wastage has been a prominent issue for years now. Our team is specifically focusing on unintended wastage of electricity, whereby users are in the midst of utilising their electronic devices, but accidentally fall asleep. As a result, their electronic devices would be left on throughout the duration they are sleeping, thereby wasting electricity.

# Proposed IoT Solution:

Our IoT system aims to be able to detect when an electronic device (i.e. TVs) is left on concurrently while the user has fallen asleep. When such a scenario is detected, our IoT will produce a stimulus to wake the user up so as to be able to turn off the electronic device, thereby preventing wastage of
electricity.
